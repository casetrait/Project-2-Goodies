# Behave to Earn (B2E) App

## Overview
---
**Goodies 4 Goodies**, is an app developed to assist parents with encouraging positive behaviours from their children. Children earn "Goody Bucks" through performing customizable tasks to earn customizable rewards. 

---
## Inspiration & Purpose of the App
---

I have a 3 year old son who I love more than anything, but often the most simple tasks like putting on his PJ's, or keeping his food on his plate, can be a challenge for the whole family. 

This app is not intended to replace traditional parenting methods to address behavioural issues, but rather to assist with developing desirable outcomes for tasks they have trouble understanding the "why?". For example: putting on their jacket and boots so you aren't late for your appointment! 

For parents with older children, the app can be used to track regular chores your child performs to earn an "allowance".
