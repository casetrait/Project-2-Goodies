# Behave2Earn App
---
## Overview
---
**Goodies 4 Goodies**, is an app developed to assist parents with encouraging positive behaviours from their children. Children earn "Goodie Points" through performing customizable tasks to earn customizable rewards. 

---
## Inspiration & Purpose of the App
---

I have a 3 year old son who I love more than anything, but often the most simple tasks like putting on his PJ's, or keeping his food on his plate, can be a challenge for the whole family. This app is not intended to be used to replace traditional parenting methods to address behavioural issues, but rather to assist with developing desirable habits from your child for tasks they have trouble understanding the "why?" such as putting on their jacket and boots so you aren't late for your appointment! 

For parents of older children, the app can be used to track regular chores your child performs to earn and "allowance".
